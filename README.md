## Key Features Explained

### Conversational AI
The core of LuxeFi is the conversational interface where users interact with LuxeBot through natural language. The AI has access to:
- Complete user financial profile
- Real-time account balances and transactions
- Goal progress and targets
- Full conversation history for context

### Context-Aware Responses
Every AI response is generated with full context including:
- User demographics and preferences
- Current financial situation
- Recent spending patterns
- Progress toward goals
- Previous conversations

### Gamification System
Users earn XP for various actions:
- Completing onboarding: +100 XP
- Each chat interaction: +5 XP
- Setting up goals: +50 XP
- Account connections: +25 XP (simulated)

Levels increase every 100 XP, with visual feedback throughout the interface.

### Data Flow
1. User interacts through chat interface
2. Frontend sends message to backend API
3. Backend compiles full user context from database
4. Context + message sent to OpenAI API (or mock response)
5. AI response saved to database and returned to frontend
6. XP awarded and UI updated with response

## Customization

### Adding New Account Types
Modify the `generateMockData` function in `server/index.js` to include additional account types.

### Extending AI Capabilities
Update the system prompt in the `/api/chat` endpoint to modify LuxeBot's personality and capabilities.

### UI Theming
Colors and styling can be customized in `tailwind.config.js` and the component-level Tailwind classes.

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL or similar production database
- Implement proper Plaid integration for real banking data
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implement rate limiting and security measures
- Set up proper environment variable management
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Implement caching for AI responses
