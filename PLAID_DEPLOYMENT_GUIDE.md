# ðŸ”§ Plaid Sandbox Deployment Guide

Since you have registered for Plaid sandbox, here's how to get it working:

## Step 1: Get Your Plaid Credentials

From your Plaid Dashboard at [dashboard.plaid.com](https://dashboard.plaid.com):

1. **Client ID**: Found in Team Settings â†’ Keys
2. **Sandbox Secret**: Found in Team Settings â†’ Keys  
3. **Environment**: Set to `sandbox`

## Step 2: Add Credentials to Supabase

### Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended):
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Secrets**
3. Add these three secrets:

```
PLAID_CLIENT_ID = your_actual_client_id_here
PLAID_SECRET = your_actual_sandbox_secret_here  
PLAID_ENV = sandbox
```

**Important**: Make sure the secret names are exactly as shown above.

## Step 3: Deploy Edge Functions Manually

Since you're in a browser environment, you need to deploy via the Supabase Dashboard:

### Deploy plaid-create-link-token:
1. Go to **Edge Functions** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"Create Function"** 
3. Name: `plaid-create-link-token`
4. Copy the entire code from `supabase/functions/plaid-create-link-token/index.ts`
5. Paste into the editor
6. Click **"Deploy Function"**

### Deploy plaid-exchange-token:
1. Click **"Create Function"**
2. Name: `plaid-exchange-token` 
3. Copy code from `supabase/functions/plaid-exchange-token/index.ts`
4. Paste and deploy

### Deploy plaid-refresh-accounts:
1. Click **"Create Function"**
2. Name: `plaid-refresh-accounts`
3. Copy code from `supabase/functions/plaid-refresh-accounts/index.ts` 
4. Paste and deploy

## Step 4: Test the Integration

After deployment:

1. Go to your app â†’ Dashboard â†’ Bank Accounts
2. Click "Add Account"
3. Select "Real Plaid Sandbox" 
4. Click "Connect via Plaid Sandbox"
5. You should see Plaid Link open with test banks

### Test Credentials:
- **Institution**: First Platypus Bank
- **Username**: `user_good`
- **Password**: `pass_good`
- **MFA**: `1234` (if prompted)

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

Your functions should be available at:
- `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/plaid-create-link-token`
- `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/plaid-exchange-token`  
- `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/plaid-refresh-accounts`

## Troubleshooting

### "Function not found" error:
- Verify function names are exactly: `plaid-create-link-token`, `plaid-exchange-token`, `plaid-refresh-accounts`
- Check that functions show "Deployed" status in dashboard

### "Plaid credentials not configured":
- Double-check secret names in Supabase: `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `PLAID_ENV`
- Verify values are correct (no extra spaces)
- Make sure `PLAID_ENV` is set to `sandbox`

### "Invalid credentials" from Plaid:
- Verify your Plaid Client ID and Secret are for sandbox environment
- Check that your Plaid account is active and verified

## Alternative: Use Demo Mode

While setting up real Plaid, you can use Demo Mode which works immediately:

1. Select "Demo Mode" instead of "Real Plaid Sandbox"
2. Get 3 realistic test accounts instantly
3. All banking features work perfectly

## What Happens After Setup

Once configured correctly:
âœ… Real Plaid Link will open with test banks  
âœ… You can connect multiple test accounts  
âœ… Account data saves to your Supabase database  
âœ… All banking features work with real Plaid data  

The UI and database are already production-ready - you just need the backend functions deployed!
